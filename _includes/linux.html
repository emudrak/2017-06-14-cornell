Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

  <ol>
    <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
      <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. LibreOffice comes
      preinstalled with several Linux distributions. If you don't already have it, use
      your package manager to install it: (e.g., <code>sudo apt-get install
	libreoffice</code> for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions).
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
  <br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs
  through a web browser, and any browser - Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer -
  should work fine.  You will need to download Google Refine and install it, and
  when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need an
  internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
	page</a>
    <li>Click on <i>Linux kit</i> to download the install file
    <li>Download and extract
    <li>Type <code>./refine</code> in your terminal and Google Refine will then
    open in your web browser.
    <li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started
      the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should
      see OpenRefine.
  </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>R</b>
    <br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
    programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the instructions for your distribution
	from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/">CRAN</a>. For most distributions, you
	can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run <code>sudo
	apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora run <code>sudo yum install
	R</code>) but make sure that you have at least R 3.2.2 (as pre-packaged
	versions might be out of date).
      <li>To install RStudio, go to
	the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download
	  page</a>
      <li>Under <i>Installers</i> select the version for your distribution.
      <li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it (or <code>sudo dpkg
	  -i rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).
      <li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
    </ul>

<p>

<li><b>Python</b>
 <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all
      <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).
    </p>
 <ul>
 <li>Open <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads</a> with your web browser.</li>
        <li>Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.<br>
          (Installation requires using the shell. If you aren't
           comfortable doing the installation yourself
           stop here and request help at the workshop.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Open a terminal window.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type <pre>bash Anaconda3-</pre> and then press
          tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
          appear. If it does not, navigate to the folder where you
          downloaded the file, for example with:
          <pre>cd Downloads</pre>
          Then, try again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. To move through
          the text, press the space key. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
          default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
          (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
        </li>
        <li>
          Close the terminal window.
      </ul>
</ul>

<!--   <li><b>SQLite</b>
    <br>
    For this workshop we're going to use the Firefox SQLite Plugin. It works through
    the web browser Firefox.
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't already have Firefox installed
	<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">install Firefox</a>
      <li>Start Firefox
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
      <li> Click the "Add Now" button.
      <li> Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
      <li> Restart Firefox when prompted.
      <li> Select "SQLite Manager" from the "Tools" menu and it will open within Firefox
    </ul>
</ol> -->
