```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## Introduction

Mammals are very important....






```{r,  echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

SHplot <- ggplot(subset(svy, species_id=="SH"), aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+geom_point()
plot(SHplot)

#comment 


```

You can calculate lines of code within the markdown section of this document

The mean animal weight is `r round(mean(svy$weight), 2)`, which very small... 
```{r  , echo=FALSE, results='hide' }
SHmodel<-lm(hindfoot_length~weight, data=subset(svy, species_id=="SH"))
SHresults<-summary(SHmodel)
SHresults

SHslope<-SHresults$coefficients[2,1]
SHpvalue <- SHresults$coefficients[2,4]

```



For species SH, a one gram change in weight results in a `r SHslope` cm change in hindfoot length (p = `r SHpvalue`). 



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. number one
1. number one and a half
1. number two
1. number three

- thing a
- thing b
- thing z

# Title
## Main Section
### Subsection


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
